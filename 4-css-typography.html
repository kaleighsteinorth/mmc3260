	<h1> About Kaleigh </h1>
		<p> Hello! I am a fourth-year journalism student at the University of Florida (Go Gators!). After beginning a yoga practice about three years ago, I found it to be the best avenue for physical exercise, stress relief and spiritual connection. I regularly update <a href="http://www.kaleighsteinorth.squarespace.com/">Inzentives</a>, a blog that I hope will help others along their journeys to zen-filled life through examples of yoga practices, mindful music choices and stress management guidance. I write all of the material for the blog, and I also incorporate photos and other forms of multimedia. </p> 
		<p>I knew I wanted to write after seeing the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116493/">Harriet the Spy</a> as a child, and through practicing yoga I have found what it is I should write about. I am so appreciative to have had the opportunity to hone my craft at the UF College of Journalism and Communications. I am from Trinity, Fla., a suburb of the Tampa Bay area, and will be graduating in the spring of 2014.
